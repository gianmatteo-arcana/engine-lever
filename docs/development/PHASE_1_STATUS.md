# Phase 1: Database Redesign - Status Report

## ✅ COMPLETED
- Migrated from 26+ tables to 9 clean business-centric tables
- Implemented append-only event sourcing with context_events
- Updated backend DatabaseService with compatibility layer
- Removed user token clients (service role only)
- Updated core database tests

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES
- **Test Coverage**: 16 of 36 test suites failing due to major schema changes
  - Core database tests updated and mostly passing
  - Other tests need updates for new schema
  - This is expected after major refactor

## 🎯 CURRENT STATE
- **Build**: ✅ Compiles successfully
- **Core Functionality**: ✅ Database service operational with compatibility layer
- **Tests**: ⚠️ Partial pass (20/36 suites passing)
- **Production Readiness**: ❌ More work needed

## 📋 TECHNICAL DEBT
1. Complete test suite updates for all agents and services
2. Remove legacy interfaces after full migration
3. Update API endpoints to use new schema directly
4. Implement proper error handling for new schema

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS
1. **Phase 2: Singleton Elimination** - Remove singleton patterns
2. **Phase 3: Clean Architecture** - Separate concerns
3. **Phase 4: Security Hardening** - Fix RLS and injection vulnerabilities

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION
Given the scope of changes, recommend:
1. Deploy to staging environment for integration testing
2. Run E2E tests to verify functionality
3. Fix remaining unit tests incrementally
4. Proceed with Phase 2 after stabilization

## 📊 METRICS
- Tables reduced: 26+ → 9 (65% reduction)
- Code complexity: Simplified with compatibility layer
- Security posture: Improved (no user token clients)
- Test coverage: Degraded temporarily (needs restoration)
