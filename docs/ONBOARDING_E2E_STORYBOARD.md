## 🤖 Agent Reasoning Deep Dive

### BusinessDiscoveryAgent Logic
```javascript
// Extract search clues
domain = extractDomain(email) // "techstartup.com"
possibleNames = generateVariations(domain)
// ["techstartup", "tech startup", "techstartup inc"]

// Prioritize search states
states = prioritizeStates(userLocation)
// ["CA", "DE", "WA"] - CA first due to location

// Search and score
for (state of states) {
  results = searchPublicRecords(state, possibleNames)
  if (confidenceScore(results) > 0.8) {
    return foundBusiness
  }
}
```

### ProfileCollectionAgent Logic
```javascript
// Smart defaults from discovery
defaults = {
  businessName: discovery.name,      // From BusinessDiscoveryAgent
  entityType: discovery.type,        // From public records
  state: discovery.state,            // From public records
  industry: inferFromName(name),     // "Tech" in name → Technology
  employeeCount: getDefault(type)    // New Corp → 1-10
}

// Calculate pre-fill percentage
prefilledFields = 5
totalFields = 8
percentage = (5/8) * 100 // 62.5%
```

### EntityComplianceAgent Logic
```javascript
// Build requirement matrix
requirements = []
requirements.push(...getFederalReqs(entityType))  // EIN, Tax forms
requirements.push(...getStateReqs(state, type))    // SOI, Franchise tax
requirements.push(...getLocalReqs(city))           // Business license
requirements.push(...getIndustryReqs(industry))    // Tech-specific

// Prioritize by deadline and consequences
requirements.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.deadline < 30) return -1  // Critical
  if (a.fine > 1000) return -1    // High priority
  return 0                         // Normal
})
```
