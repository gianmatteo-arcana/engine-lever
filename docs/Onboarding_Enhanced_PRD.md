Executive Summary
An intelligent, agent-orchestrated onboarding system that builds a complete business profile through minimal user interaction. The system operates autonomously in the background, leveraging Google OAuth data, public records, and intelligent inference to gather information, pausing only when critical user verification or unique business details are required. The onboarding appears as a friendly overlay on the main dashboard, ensuring users immediately see their workspace while being guided through setup.

The Magic of Agent-Orchestrated Onboarding
Our onboarding system represents a paradigm shift from traditional form-based onboarding. Instead of presenting users with lengthy forms, our specialized agents work behind the scenes like a helpful assistant who already knows a lot about you.
The magic happens through:

Zero forms by default - Agents gather data from Google profile, public records, and intelligent inference
Contextual micro-interactions - Users only see questions agents couldn't answer autonomously
Progressive enhancement - Basic functionality unlocks immediately, advanced features as we learn more
Mobile-first simplicity - Complex business data collection made thumb-friendly
Intelligent adaptation - Different businesses see completely different flows based on their context

When John from TechStartup LLC signs up, our agents might already know he's a Delaware C-Corp from his email domain research, find his EIN from public records, and only need to ask if he has employees. Meanwhile, Sarah's home bakery sees questions about food permits and home business regulations. Same system, completely different experience.

Core Architectural Pattern
Following our declarative pattern, the onboarding task defines WHAT information we need to serve the business effectively, not HOW to collect it. The Orchestrator and specialized agents determine the optimal collection strategy based on available data sources and business context.

How the Orchestrator Interprets Onboarding
yaml# Orchestrator's Dynamic Execution Plan (Generated at Runtime)
orchestrator_analysis:
  user_context:
    - Name: "John Doe" (from Google)
    - Email: "john@techstartup.com"
    - Email domain: "techstartup.com" (potential company)
    - Location: San Francisco (from IP)
    - First time user: true

example_optimization:
  instead_of: "Enter your business information"
  
  show:
    screen_1: "Hi John! Is TechStartup Inc your business?"
    quick_actions: ["Yes, that's me!", "Different business"]
    
    screen_2: "Great! Looks like a Delaware C-Corp?"
    quick_actions: ["Exactly right", "Actually, it's..."]
    
    celebration: "Awesome! We found your info in public records"
    value_prop: "We can now track your DE franchise tax deadlines"

UI Augmentation for Onboarding
The Intelligence Layer
When onboarding begins, multiple agents work in parallel—some researching in the background, others preparing UI requests. The Data Enrichment Agent might discover from the email domain that this is likely a tech startup. The Public Records Agent searches Delaware corporations. The UX Optimization Agent watches all discoveries and crafts the perfect first question.
Instead of a generic "What's your business name?" form, the user sees: "Hi John! We found TechStartup Inc (Delaware C-Corp) - is this your business?" with a simple Yes/No choice. This intelligence-driven approach means most users complete onboarding in under 2 minutes with just 3-5 taps.

Multiple valid end states
Return and enhance later
Skip non-critical items
No "locked out" features

Conclusion
This onboarding system transforms the traditionally painful process of business profile creation into a delightful, intelligent experience. By leveraging public data, smart inference, and progressive disclosure, we reduce a typical 20-minute form-filling exercise to a 2-minute conversation.
The magic lies not in asking users for less information, but in finding that information ourselves and simply asking for confirmation. When John sees "Is TechStartup Inc your business?" instead of a blank form, we've already saved him time and demonstrated our value.
This agent-orchestrated approach scales beautifully—from sole proprietors to complex corporations, from tech startups to local bakeries—each seeing a personalized flow that speaks their language and understands their needs. The result is higher completion rates, faster time-to-value, and users who actually enjoy onboarding.
