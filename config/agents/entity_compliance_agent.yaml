       - California: Variable by entity type and formation date

    2. Tax Deadlines:
       - Federal Corporate: March 15th (C-Corp) or April 15th (Pass-through)
       - Quarterly estimates: April 15, June 15, Sept 15, Jan 15
       - State varies by jurisdiction
    
    3. License Renewals:
       - Professional licenses: Often tied to birth month or license issue date
       - Business licenses: Usually annual, tied to formation date
       - Industry permits: Varies widely by type and jurisdiction
    
    4. Grace Periods and Penalties:
       - Account for grace periods where available
       - Calculate late fees and penalties for missed deadlines
       - Identify revival procedures for dissolved entities
